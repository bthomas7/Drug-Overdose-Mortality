Drug Overdose Mortality
=======================

Opioid addiction and misuse has become a national crisis leading to an overall increase in deaths due to drug overdoses. Data available at [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Drug-Poisoning-Mortality-by-State-United-Stat/xbxb-epbu) shows the annual number of deaths due to drug poisoning for 1999 through 2016 for each state. 

This [shiny app](https://bthomas7.shinyapps.io/overdose/) allows you to visualize the changes in crude death rate (in terms of 100,000 people) for each state as compared to death rates in 2016.
